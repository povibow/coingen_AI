# CoinGen-AI

---

## Project Summary
**CoinGen-AI** is a utility that allows users to create their own cryptocurrency coins with the help of artificial intelligence. By inputting basic details like the coin name, purpose, and intended audience, the program generates a unique logo and metadata for your new digital asset.

**Purpose:**  
To provide a flexible tool for exploring the design and marketing of new cryptocurrencies through AI-generated visuals and descriptions.

## Key Features
- **Custom Coin Logos:** Generates a distinctive coin logo based on the entered parameters.
- **Coin Metadata Generation:** Creates detailed metadata including coin name, symbol, launch date, and purpose.
- **Automated Descriptions:** Generates descriptions based on key attributes provided by the user.
- **Pre-defined Templates:** Uses structured templates to create consistent promotional content for the coin.

## How It Works
1. **User Input:** The user provides essential information about the coin (e.g., name, purpose, target audience).
2. **AI Logo Generation:** The program creates a logo for the coin using a basic visual design model.
3. **Metadata and Descriptions:** CoinGen-AI produces metadata and a description tailored to the user's inputs.
4. **Output:** Saves the generated assets (logo and metadata) in a dedicated folder.
